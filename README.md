# Adaptive Noise Mitigation System for Noise Senitive Areas

## 📄 Abstract

This project implements an Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) system using the Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm and real-time audio processing in Python. A reference microphone captures the ambient noise, and an adaptive FIR filter generates an anti-noise signal to destructively interfere with it. An error microphone monitors the remaining noise to adaptively fine-tune the filter weights.

Even though ANC is complex to implement in physical setups due to delays, reflections, and cost constraints, it remains a promising and actively researched field. Our implementation highlights key challenges and gives insight into both the potential and limitations of real-world ANC systems.

We also submitted a technical paper based on this project to the National Power Conference held at Muthoot Institute of Technology & Science, Kochi.

## 🖼️ Project Setup

Setup includes a duct made of pvc with y joint provided in the midway,one reference microphone and one reference microphone, a speaker that generates noise and a speaker that generates anti-noise signal

We have used laptop as ANC controller to make the development more flexible. Complete details about the project has been provided in the report provided.

## 📊 Simulation Results (MATLAB)

We simulated the ANC system in a virtual room created in MATLAB. Simulation shows effective noise attenuation and algorithm convergence.
